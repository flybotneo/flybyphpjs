FLYBYPHPJS
==========

FlyByPhpJs is a mini framework written in PHP and Javascript. 

I am developing it with the aim to allow easy experimentation and prototyping of web applications for amateur programmers like me.

I am well aware that out there is plenty of powerful and solid tools in order to achieve high performance, high quality results, but they're not suitable for tiny projects and newbies.

The framework although functiontal should be used for testing purposes only.

NO WARRANTY can be given, nor I could be held responsible for every damage it could cause. Use at your own risk.
